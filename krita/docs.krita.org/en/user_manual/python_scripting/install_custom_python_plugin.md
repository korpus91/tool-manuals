# Managing Python plugins¶

## How to install a Python plugin¶

Caution

Custom Python plugins are made by users of Krita and the Krita team does not guarantee that they work, that they are useful or that they are safe. Note that a Python plugin can do everything that Krita can do, which means for example access to your files. Krita team isn’t responsible for any damage you might suffer from the plugin, and you install it on your own risk.

### Using Python plugin importer¶

Note

This method doesn’t always import action files (responsible for shortcuts) correctly.

You need to ensure that you have the plugin in a *.zip file. Inside the zip file there should be a file pluginname.desktop and a folder pluginname (instead of pluginname there should be an actual unique name of the plugin).

Go to Tools ‣ Scripts ‣ Import Python Plugin…, find the *.zip file and press OK. Restart Krita.

Go to Configure Krita ‣ Python Plugins Manager, find the plugin and enable it. Restart Krita.

Now the plugin should be available.

### Manually¶

If the plugin is inside a *.zip archive, you need to extract it first.

Go to Settings ‣ Manage Resources ‣ Open Resource Folder. Put file pluginname.desktop and folder pluginname (instead of pluginname there should be an actual unique name of the plugin) inside the pykrita folder. Put file pluginname.action into the actions folder. Restart Krita.

Now the plugin should be available.

## How to get to the plugin?¶

Plugins in Krita are either dockers or extensions.

If it’s an extension, it will be available in the menu Tools ‣ Scripts.

When it’s a docker, you can find it in Settings ‣ Dockers.

If the plugin has any shortcuts, and you imported the action file properly, you can change the shortcuts in Configure Krita ‣ Keyboard Shortcuts.

## How to enable and disable a plugin?¶

You can enable and disable all plugins (no matter if they’re pre-installed or custom) in Configure Krita ‣ Python Plugins Manager.
