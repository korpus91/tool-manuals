# Split Layer¶

Splits a layer according to color. This is useful in combination with the Colorize Mask and the R +  shortcut to select layers at the cursor.

At the top, of the dialog there is a dropdown, here you can choose between…

Split Into Layers

The image’s colors is split into paint layers. Fantastic for artwork that works more with flats, such as the cel-shaded look.

Split Into Local Selection Masks

Added in version 4.2.9.

The image’s colors are outlined as a selection, and a Selection Masks is made. This is useful for artwork that has a more painterly look, with the selection masks making it easy to select several areas at once. Because selection masks are not paint layers, several of the options below are unavailable.

The other options are:

Put all new layers in a group layer

Put all the result layers into a new group.

Put every layer in its own, separate group layer

Put each layer into its own group.

Alpha-lock every new layer

Enable the alpha-lock for each layer so it is easier to color.

Hide the original layer

Turns off the visibility on the original layer so you won’t get confused.

Sort layers by amount of non-transparent pixels

This ensures that the layers with large color swathes will end up at the top.

Disregard opacity

Whether to take into account transparency of a color.

Fuzziness

How precise the algorithm should be. The larger the fuzziness, the less precise the algorithm will be. This is necessary for splitting layers with anti-aliasing, because otherwise you would end up with a separate layer for each tiny pixel.

Palette to use for naming the layers

Select the palette to use for naming. Krita will compare the main color of a layer to each color in the palette to get the most appropriate name for it.
