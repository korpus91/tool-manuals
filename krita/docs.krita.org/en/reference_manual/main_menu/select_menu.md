Select Opaque¶

Select all opaque (non-transparent) pixels in the current active layer. If there’s already a selection, this will add the new selection to the old one, allowing you to select the opaque pixels of multiple layers into one selection. Semi-transparent (or semi-opaque) pixels will be semi-selected.

Select Opaque (Replace)

Only select the opaque pixels of the layer, regardless of selection.

Select Opaque (Add)

Adds the new selection from opaque pixels to the current selection.

Select Opaque (Subtract)

Subtracts the new selection from opaque pixels from the current selection.

Select Opaque (Intersection)

Gets the intersection between the new selection from opaque pixels and the current selection.

Feathering in design means to soften sharp borders. So this adds a soft border to the existing selection. Shortcut Shift + F6

Grow Selection…¶

Make the selection a few pixels bigger.

Shrink Selection…¶

Make the selection a few pixels smaller.

Border Selection…¶

Take the current selection and remove the insides so you only have a border selected.

Smooth¶

Make the selection a little smoother. This removes jiggle.
