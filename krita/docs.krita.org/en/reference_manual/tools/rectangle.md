# Rectangle Tool¶

This tool can be used to paint rectangles, or create rectangle shapes on a vector layer. Click and hold  to indicate one corner of the rectangle, drag to the opposite corner, and release the button.

## Hotkeys and Sticky-keys¶

There’s no default hotkey for switching to rectangle.

If you hold the Shift key while drawing, a square will be drawn instead of a rectangle. Holding the Ctrl key will change the way the rectangle is constructed. Normally, the first mouse click indicates one corner and the second click the opposite. With the Ctrl key, the initial mouse position indicates the center of the rectangle, and the final mouse position indicates a corner. You can press the Alt key while still keeping  down to move the rectangle to a different location.

You can change between the corner/corner and center/corner drawing methods as often as you want by pressing or releasing the Ctrl key, provided that you keep  pressed. With the Ctrl key pressed, mouse movements will affect all four corners of the rectangle (relative to the center), without the Ctrl key, one of the corners is unaffected.

Added in version 5.0.

If you hold Ctrl and Alt keys while drawing, the rectangle will be rotated around the marked corner. If used with holding Shift key, a square will be rotated around the marked corner.
