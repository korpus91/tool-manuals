# Clones Array¶

Allows you to create a set of clone layers quickly. These are ordered in terms of rows and columns. The default options will create a 2 by 2 grid. For setting up tiles of an isometric game, for example, you’d want to set the X offset of the rows to half the value input into the X offset for the columns, so that rows are offset by half. For a hexagonal grid, you’d want to do the same, but also reduce the Y offset of the grids by the amount of space the hexagon can overlap with itself when tiled.

- Elements

The amount of elements that should be generated using a negative of the offset.

+ Elements

The amount of elements that should be generated using a positive of the offset.

X offset

The X offset in pixels. Use this in combination with Y offset to position a clone using Cartesian coordinates.

Y offset

The Y offset in pixels. Use this in combination with X offset to position a clone using Cartesian coordinates.

Distance

The line-distance of the original origin to the clones origin. Use this in combination with angle to position a clone using a polar coordinate system.

Angle

The angle-offset of the column or row. Use this in combination with distance to position a clone using a polar coordinate system.
